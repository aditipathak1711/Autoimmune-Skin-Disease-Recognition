Deep Learning Based Model for Efficient Detection of Autoimmune Skin Disorders using Pre-trained Model DenseNet

Abstract - This project involves building an image classification model using a pre-trained DenseNet to classify images of different autoimmune skin diseases. The process includes preparing the dataset, removing duplicate images, data augmentation, modifying the pretrained model, and evaluating its performance. The code is structured to run on Kaggle. The model had 4 labels - Vitiligo, Psoriasis, Lichen Planus and Normal Skin. The model is executed with a test accuracy of 96% and an f1 score of 0.96.
