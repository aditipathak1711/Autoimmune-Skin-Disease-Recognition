Advanced Deep Learning Techniques for Accurate Classification of Dermatological Conditions


Abstract - This project involves building an image classification model using a pre-trained VGG16 model to classify images of different autoimmune skin diseases. The process includes setting up the environment, preparing the dataset, modifying the pre-trained model, fine tuning the model, and evaluating its performance. The code is structured to run on Google Colab, leveraging Google Drive for dataset storage. This project leverages a pre-trained VGG16 model to classify images of skin diseases. The model is fine-tuned on a custom dataset stored in Google Drive, using data augmentation to improve generalization. The training process involves setting up the environment, preparing the dataset, modifying the pre-trained model, and training it using augmented data. The model had 4 labels - Vitiligo, Psoriasis, Lichen Planus and Normal Skin. The accuracy achieved by the model is 86.25%
